	<h2><strong> About the Guide de Bordeaux </strong></h2>
	<p1> Since we have all lived in Bordeaux for a while now we feel a strong of sense of pride and community for Bordeaux and what it has to offer. Since travel is now open again after the COVID-19 Pandemic, we aim to help businesses and communities affected by the lack of tourism by creating an interactive database that businesses can feature their restaurants, services, and more! </p1>
